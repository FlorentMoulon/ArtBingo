As of right now we created a website with a functioning grid, functioning API button and a second working page accessible from the grid.
On the camera page you can take a picture and send it to the AI Object Recognition which will give back the most accurate and close object.
On the last update I added a Home page button so that the user is able to go from the Camera page to the fist initial grid page.

Update 6.02.2025
New fonts and colors all around the website. Adjusted camera and photo dimensions to fit smartphones screens. Added timer, points and checks for the grid cells. Adjusted the home button function and finally added a final page at the end of the game.
