As of right now we created a website with a functioning grid, functioning API button and a second working page accessible from the grid.
On the camera page you can take a picture and send it to the AI Object Recognition which will give back the most accurate and close object.
On the last update I added a Home page button so that the user is able to go from the Camera page to the fist initial grid page.
